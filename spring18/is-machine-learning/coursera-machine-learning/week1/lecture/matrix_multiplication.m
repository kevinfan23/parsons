% Initialize matrix A
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6;7, 8, 9]

% Initialize vector v
v = [1; 1; 1]

% Multiply A * v
Av = A * v

% Initialize a 3 by 2 matrix
A = [1, 2; 3, 4;5, 6]

% Initialize a 2 by 1 matrix
B = [1; 2]

% We expect a resulting matrix of (3 by 2)*(2 by 1) = (3 by 1)
mult_AB = A*B

% Initialize random matrices A and B
A = [1,2;4,5]
B = [1,1;0,2]

% Initialize a 2 by 2 identity matrix
I = eye(2)

% The above notation is the same as I = [1,0;0,1]

% What happens when we multiply I*A ?
IA = I*A

% How about A*I ?
AI = A*I

% Compute A*B
AB = A*B

% Is it equal to B*A?
BA = B*A

% Note that IA = AI but AB != BA
